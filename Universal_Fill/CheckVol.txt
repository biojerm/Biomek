' When refilling the water I wanted to move the pod to the P1 position.  However, normally
'   what was happening is that The move step would get exicuted but then the puase would
'   happen and prevent the pod from moving.  To fix this I added a new property to the 
'   script. below is how

   ' 1) Select script in step window to left
   ' 2) Press Control+Shift+U
   ' 3) Right ciock root and add value
   ' 4) Name value "Dynamic?", set it to Boolean  and value is true
   ' 5) Press Control+Shift+U again
